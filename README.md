The Techne Society
==================

Before the First Day
--------------------

For us to be able to hit the ground running, there are a couple of things that members should have done before the second official meeting. We can spend some time during the first meeting configuring our computers, but the more that's done earlier, the more time we'll spend working with our tools (which is the fun part)!

Safety Gear and Materials
-------------------------

Each member must have his or her own pair of safety glasses. I find that the bulky lab-style glasses impair vision so much that they're a net detriment to workshop safety. I recommend a sunglasses-style pair like [these from Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11046) or [these from Home Depot](http://www.homedepot.com/p/3M-Tekk-Protection-Indoor-Safety-Eyewear-with-Clear-Lens-90551-00000B/202552394?N=5yc1vZc1xt).

Each member will also want to have a graph-ruled notebook. I find [Sparkfun's notebooks](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11064) excellent, though others will do. The kind most commonly found in schools have vexingly dark lines that make technical drawing difficult.

Mr. Carey will be placing an order for some inital supplies on Friday September 5th. If you contact him before noon that day, he can include safety glasses and a notebook for you in the order.

Laptop and Software
-------------------

Each member will need a laptop computer. The laptop should be running a vaguely recent version of Mac OS X, Windows 7 (or 8 if you must), or some sensible distribution of Linux. It should be able to connect to a wireless network and have at least one USB port. The software and data we produce during the year should occupy 5-10 gigabytes.

In addition to that hardware, you will need some software and accounts:

###A text editor.

We'll be doing some programming. Programming is just editing text files, so you'll want a good text editor. Note that word processors like Microsoft Word and Pages are not a text editors; they add weird stuff to text files that make them unsuitable for programming.

- For Mac OS X, [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), available as a free download from Apple will do nicely. I also use [TextMate](http://macromates.com), but it costs actual dollars, so don't feel obliged to buy it.

- For Windows, [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org) is the gold standard, and a free download to boot.

- I don't personally use Linux all that often, so you're sort of on your own. vim is probably a decent choice, as is some version of emacs?

###The Arduino Integrated Development Environment

When we begin to do electronics work we'll use the Arduino platform. You'll need to download and install the [Adruino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your computer's operating system. Version 1.0.5 is fine.

###GitHub

We're going to use a website called [GitHub](www.github.com) to communcate, share code, and host our creations. You'll need to sign up for an account and e-mail your account name to billcarey_nospam@mac.com. Professional programmers use GitHub and the work we do will be public, so your username should represent you, your school, and your faith well. YourFirstNameLastName works if it's available. The free open source plan is fine.

Once you've signed up, you'll need to download the Git client. GitHub provides a [Mac OS X client](https://mac.github.com) and a [Windows client](https://windows.github.com). If you're using linux, you'll need to download [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and run it from the command line. I do that at work, and it's less difficult than you'd think.
